### About Me

Greetings, fellow coders and curious minds! 🚀 I'm a FullStack Developer with an insatiable appetite for JavaScript, PHP and a knack for creating web magic. I've dabbled with so many technologies that my computer sometimes thinks it's at a tech buffet. 🍕

![Tech Buffet](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wqPjliMc--/c_imagga_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_420,q_auto,w_1000/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/3gjbeg830gnu43sxz7et.png)

I've traversed the realms of JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Angular, Vue, HTML, CSS, Redux, Redux Toolkit, Vuex, NgRx, MobX, Zustand, GraphQL, AWS, Git, Jest, Cypress, Storybook, Vite, React Native, MUI, Ant Design, Chakra UI, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Responsive Web Apps, Progressive Web Apps, Stripe, SEO, and even the mysterious land of WCAG. Phew! 😅

When I'm not busy making the internet a more beautiful and functional place, you can find me sipping coffee, contemplating the meaning of life, and debating whether semicolons belong in JavaScript. 🤔
